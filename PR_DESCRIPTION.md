# 🎨 Portfolio UI/UX Improvements & Theme System Enhancements

## 📋 Overview
This PR contains significant improvements to the portfolio's user interface, user experience, and theme system reliability. The changes focus on better visual consistency, improved accessibility, and a more robust light/dark mode implementation.

## ✨ Key Changes

### 🌓 Theme System Improvements
- **Fixed Light Mode Bug**: Removed conflicting `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` CSS rules that were overriding class-based theming
- **Improved Theme Reliability**: Light/dark mode toggle now works consistently regardless of system preferences
- **Class-based Theming**: Ensures `.light` and `.dark` classes take precedence over system preferences

### 🎯 Experience Section Redesign
- **Unified Layout**: Changed from alternating left/right timeline layout to consistent left-aligned cards
- **Improved Typography**: Increased font sizes for better readability:
  - Job titles: `text-lg` → `text-xl`
  - Company names: Added `text-lg` for better prominence
  - Descriptions: `text-sm` → `text-base`
  - Bullet points: Enhanced spacing and sizing
- **Better Spacing**: Increased padding and margins throughout the section
- **Enhanced Cards**: Larger cards (`max-w-lg` → `max-w-2xl`) with improved visual hierarchy
- **Consistent Arrows**: Simplified card arrows to always point from the timeline

### 🎨 Visual Polish
- **Better Text Hierarchy**: Improved spacing between elements for cleaner visual flow
- **Enhanced Readability**: Larger text sizes and better contrast throughout
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified component spacing and typography

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Modal Positioning**: Added CSS rules for better modal centering (work in progress)
- **Component Reorganization**: Moved ExperienceModal to render via portal for better positioning
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused variables and simplified conditional logic
